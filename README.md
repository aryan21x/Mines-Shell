Mines Shell (mish) is a simplified Unix shell implemented in C++, designed to execute user commands by forking child processes, handling built-in commands (cd, exit, and environment assignments), and supporting features like I/O redirection, background execution, command piping, and batch mode. The shell parses input using a defined grammar and enforces proper syntax and error handling, offering a foundational experience in Unix process management and command-line interface design.
